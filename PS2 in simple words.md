Siddanth has moved to a new city and he's shopping for groceries. He has some dietary restrictions, so he needs to be careful about what he eats. But with so many products in the supermarket, it's hard for him to check every label to see if it's safe for him to eat. He needs an app to help him with this.

Here's what the app could do:

1. **Safe Stores**: The app could tell Siddanth which stores have products that are safe for him. For example, if he's lactose intolerant, it could direct him to a store that has a good selection of lactose-free products.

2. **Allergy Alerts**: If Siddanth eats something that causes an allergic reaction, he can report it on the app. This could help other users who have the same allergy.

3. **Community Page**: Users can talk about different food products and share their experiences. For example, if someone finds a great gluten-free bread, they can recommend it to others on the app.

4. **Recipes**: The app could suggest recipes that fit Siddanth's dietary needs. For example, if he's vegetarian, it could suggest a variety of vegetarian recipes for him to try.

5. **Offline Access**: Even if Siddanth's internet is down, he can still use the app to check if a product is safe for him.

6. **Recommendations**: The app could suggest products based on what other users with similar dietary restrictions are buying. For example, if another user with a peanut allergy frequently buys a certain brand of peanut-free cookies, the app could suggest these cookies to Siddanth.

7. **Store Navigation**: The app could help Siddanth find his way around a store. For example, if he's looking for gluten-free products, the app could tell him exactly where to find them in the store.

In simple terms, this app is like a personal shopping assistant for people with dietary restrictions. It helps them find safe products, connect with others who have similar dietary needs, and even discover new recipes they can enjoy.
